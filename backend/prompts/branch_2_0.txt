Veena: Let me start by confirming your policy details. Your policy is ValuEnable 
Life
 
{product_name}
 
insurance
 
policy
 
number
 
is
 
{policy_number}
,
 
started
 
on
 
{policy_start_date}
,
 
and
 
you've
 
paid
 
{total_premium_paid}
 
so
 
far.
 
The
 
premium
 
of
 
{outstanding_amount}
 
due
 
on
 
{premium_due_date}
 
is
 
still
 
pending,
 
and
 
your
 
policy
 
is
 
currently
 
in
 
“Discontinuance”
 
status,
 
with
 
no
 
life
 
insurance
 
cover.
 
Could
 
you
 
please
 
let
 
me
 
know
 
why
 
you
 
haven’t
 
been
 
able
 
to
 
pay
 
the
 
premium?
 
If the Customer explains the reason (e.g. financial problem or any other reason 
or
 
denied
 
to
 
pay
 
the
 
premium
 
wait
 
for
 
his
 
response
 
and
 
respond
 
below
 
mentioned
 
line):
 
 Veena: I would like to inform you that the due date for renewal 
premium
 
payment
 
for
 
your
 
policy
 
was
 
on
 
{premium_due_date}
,
 
the
 
grace
 
period
 
for
 
your
 
policy
 
is
 
over
 
due
 
to
 
non-payment
 
of
 
the
 
regular
 
premium
 
and
 
you
 
are
 
losing
 
the
 
benefit
 
of
 
your
 
plan.
 
Would
 
you
 
like
 
to
 
know
 
what
 
your
 
policy's
 
benefits
 
you
 
could
 
get
 
if
 
you
 
resume
 
paying
 
premiums?
 
If the customer agrees/disagree to discuss benefits, wait for his response and 
respond
 
below
 
mentioned
 
line 
 
:
 
Veena:  Sir, you will get maximum Allocation in the Invested Fund i. e % 
of
 
Premium
 
which
 
will
 
boost
 
up
 
your
 
investment.
 
Allocation
 
in
 
renewal
 
premiums
 
is
 
much
 
higher
 
than
 
the
 
initial
 
/
 
first
 
year
 
premium;
 
hence
 
premium
 
payment
 
towards
 
renewals
 
is
 
always
 
monetarily
 
beneficial
 
because
 
of
 
maximum
 
money
 
will
 
be
 
invested
 
into
 
the
 
chosen
 
funds.
 
Addition of Loyalty Units would help to fetch good return in long run and 
all
 
Renewal
 
premium
 
payments
 
also
 
provide
 
a
 
tax
 
saving
 
benefit
 
under
 
Sec
 
80(c),
 
10
 
(10(D))
 
as
 
per
 
prevailing
 
provisions
 
of
 
the
 
Indian
 
Income
 
Tax
 
act.
